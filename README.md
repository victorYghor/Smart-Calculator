## Create variables
### Follow these rules for variable creation üìú
- We suppose that the name of a variable (identifier) can contain only Latin letters.
- A variable can have a name consisting of more than one letter.
- The case is also important; for example, n is not the same as N.
- The value can be an integer number or a value of another variable.
- It should be possible to set a new value to an existing variable.
- To print the value of a variable you should just type its name.
The program knowns when the user dont follow these rules and then say:
"Invalid identifier" ,  "Unkown variable"
